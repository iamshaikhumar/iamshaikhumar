Director of Data Engineering | Cloud Data Platforms | Security-Aware Analytics | GenAI Evaluation

I design and lead modern data platforms in the public sector, with a focus on reliability,
governance, and security-by-design.

This GitHub is where I intend to publish reference architectures, labs, and technical notes that reflect
how production data systems should be built — using synthetic data and generalized designs only.

## Areas of focus
- Azure data platform architecture (batch and streaming)
- Data quality, observability, and governance
- Secure data pipelines and threat-aware design
- GenAI for analytics, with evaluation and guardrails
- Eureka moments from my own experience

## What this is (and is not)
- Reference implementations
- No proprietary or confidential state data

Opinions expressed here are my own.
